???

When we get new data in our hands, first thing we do is to explore.
For that, summarizing data is very useful, but sometimes we need also to
visualize data to be able to understand it or look at outliers.

But most importantly, we need to check whether the data is in correct
format and contains logical variables. We call this usable data format...

---

## Tidy data

???

... tidy data.

At first, you might think that tidy data is the one where all the missing or
unreliable datapoints are removed. But no!

--

**is not:**

- data with missing values removed
- data with unreliable measurements removed
- data that looks nice in Excel

???

So what is it?

--

**is:**

OBSERVATIONS = ROWS

VARIABLES = COLUMNS

???

This is a format of data where each observation is in a row and each
variable is in a column. Let's look at some examples.

---

## Tidy data
### Examples

|             | treatmenta  |  treatmentb |
|:------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| John Smith  |  ---        |  2          |
| Jane Doe    |  16         |  11         |
| Mary Johnson |  3         |   1         |

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Table 1:</span> Typical presentation dataset.
</div>

|             | John Smith  | Jane Doe    |  Mary Johnson |
|:------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| treatmenta  |  -          | 16          |     3         |
| treatmentb  |  2          |  11         |   1           |


<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Table 2:</span> The same data as in Table 1 but structured differently.
</div>

<p style="font-size: small; font-style: italic; position: absolute; bottom: 40px;">

</p>

???

Why these datasets are not tidy?

The values under `treatmenta` and `treatmentb` are measuring the same thing,
but perhaps at a different time, so these are not two variables.

What would happen if we started analysing this and suddenly, we will get more
data where there are now treatments a, b, and c? We would have to re-write
the analysis scripts because we have had only a and b until now.

In Table 2 - how do we approach analysis here? We have (potentially) very many
columns with persons - should we analyse each separately by hand?

---

## Tidy data
### Examples - ctd

| person  | treatment | result |
|:--------|:---------:|:------:|
| John Smith | a | â€” |
| Jane Doe   | a | 16 |
| Mary Johnson | a | 3 |
| John Smith | b | 2 |
| Jane Doe | b | 11 |
| Mary Johnson | b | 1 |

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Table 3:</span> The same data as in Table 1 but with variables in columns and observations in rows.
</div>

???

With tidy data, we can create a script that gathers all the treatment per
person and e.g., compares the results. This script will be unchanged if there
come more persons to our study or if the treatment changes.

If data is tidy, it's easier to automate the exploration and analysis.

## Automatic summary

- depends on the data type _(character, factor, numeric, date/time)_

- duplicated measurements

- missing data

- correlated variables

---

## Automatic summary

- tools:

    - `{skimr}`    
    *basic summary of each variable,*
    
    - `{DataExplorer}`    
    *automatic data exploration, with plots, correlations between variables, etc.*
    
    - `{dataReporter}`    
    *automatic report, detailed, focus on potential problems in data*

Questions

- was it easy to imagine the data?
- how did you start drawing?
- did you change your point of view of the data _after_ you've sketched it?
- what questions arised when you saw the data plotted?

## Data viz _design_


???

It's not enough to _show_ your data - you need to carefuly pick the datapoints you want to focus on,
think about the fonts, the axes, the orientation of the plot, the colors(!), and title/captions.

All this process is called _designing_ your visual.

And as with any other design or planning, it all starts with...

--

- `r fa("pencil-alt")` pen & `r fa("sticky-note")` paper

???

When you grab a blank sheet of paper, you're getting free of all the limitations that a tool of your choice can give you.
And of the frustrations as well, if you're only beginning to learn the tool!
With a pen and paper, you may focus on what's important for the presentation of the data...

--

- `r fa("question-circle")` what the data tells me?

???

Normally, we would plot data when we want to explore some variables or when we have results of an analysis.
One thing is known: we don't know how the data look like. We may know how it _should_ look like, though.
That's why we may start designing with one type of plot in mind, but in the end the plot might look completely different!
That's why it's important to draw by hand some sketches and think about the question here.
When we finally have plotted something and understood the message behind the data, we need to improve the visual.

-  _([example](#plot_examples))_

???

- do we really need all the points?
- what about the axis ticks? and axis labels?
- can we include a take-home message in title/caption?
- is the legend in right place?
- have we used **color** wisely? (I will talk about the colors next)

--

<br>
> Who's my target audience?

???

This entire process needs to be repeated when we present our plot for different groups of people!

This process is very important and one could talk about this for hours. I've just mentioned important points, and gathered some references for you to read if you're interested.

## Plot type

Plethora of plot types!

- good short info about most used types: https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/chart-guide
- all, including more exotic types: https://datavizproject.com/

--

Different type, based on:

- continuous vs. categorical data
- all points vs. averaged/smoothed
- categories, time series, etc.

Some tips:

- [lasagne plot](#spaghetti) _if you really need to plot **all** the data points_
- [circles and bars](#area) _size matters!_

???

But the most important tip you get from me on choosing the plot type is...

class: inverse, right, middle

## `r fa("skull-crossbones")` DON'T USE PIE CHART! `r fa("skull-crossbones")`

### too high ink:information ratio

### area is difficult to grasp

### bars or points are _much better!_

???

Pie chart is OK when showing two-three categories - this requires then much "ink"
and gives relatively little information. Although nowadays, nobody cares much
about "ink", the low ink:information ratio is still considered as one of the
markers of good quality in visual design.

Human eye is not able to assess correctly small changes in area!

Bars or points are much easier to create and much easier to read!

## Choosing color

- **accessibility!**

- good tool for choosing palette: [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)    
by Cynthia Brewer

- recommended paper:    
[Crameri, F., Shephard, G. E., & Heron, P. J. *(2020)*. The misuse of colour in science communication. *Nature Communications*, 11(1), 1â€“10.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19160-7)

> `r fa("exclamation-triangle")` wrong color palette can _distort_ the data and
> _change_ the meaning of your visual

???

Colors are important - they create meaning, grab viewer's attention, show
differences or similarities, and when used wrongly can distort the information.

We want to choose the colors _wisely_, so that everyone can get the information
we wanted to show with ease. **Everyone** = we need to consider those who have
problems with seeing all colors or problems with seeing at all. **With ease** =
watch out for colors that are associated with a specific meaning.

What to consider when choosing colors:

- are there colors that _naturally_ come to mind when thinking about the 
information we want to display? (e.g., hot-cold areas, bad-good treatments,
seasonal change in measurements)

    - check here: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/
    - blog post: https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2021/6/8/colors-and-emotions-in-data-visualization

- do I need colors or is it enough with gray-shades?

- is the color scale continuous or categorical?

- _in case of continuous color scale:_ is it the best way to present a change or
would it be enough to show, e.g., size or bars along a timeline?

- _when dealing with very many categories:_ can a handfull of them be colored,
leaving the rest in gray, for contrast?

## SUMMARY

### know your data

???

So what we've learned til now:

- spend time on exploring the data and check what the data tells you

--

### know your audience

???

- when critiquing the plot, have in mind who will look at it and under what circumstances!
- you can't show the same plot in a scientific journal article, and during a presentation for students!

--
### _design_ your visual

???

- use time to design the visual
- don't just show all the data you have, but choose carefully what to show and how so that the message is clear
